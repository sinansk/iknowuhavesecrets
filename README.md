# iknowuhavesecrets

The focus of this project was authentcation and security for me. I managed it by using mongodb atlas, mongoose, passportJs, dotenv, google and facebook API's.
You can register and login by your e-mail or google-facebook account.
You can share and read secrets anonymously.
I uploaded it on heroku server.
Hope to improve and add new features!
